# Hi, I'm Hana  

I'm a **policy researcher and data analyst** passionate about poverty reduction, equity, and inclusive development.  
I recently completed my Master of Public Policy at the **University of Virginia (UVA)**, where I specialized in **quantitative methods, data analysis, and development policy**.  

My work bridges **rigorous analysis** with **policy relevance**: I use tools like **Stata, R, ArcGIS, and SQL** to turn complex datasets into actionable insights for governments, NGOs, and development partners.  

I am originally from **Sudan** and bring a perspective shaped by both the challenges of fragile states and the opportunities of inclusive development. I earned my **B.Sc. in Accounting and Finance** from the **University of Khartoum**, where I built a strong foundation in economics, financial analysis, and quantitative methods. I am currently a **Research Assistant at UVA‚Äôs Center for Social Innovation**. In this role, I work on projects related to **poverty, urban service delivery and spatial inequality**, focusing on informal settlements in Cape Town. My work involves cleaning and merging large administrative datasets, applying econometric methods in Stata and R, and using ArcGIS to map disparities in access to basic services. Across my academic and professional experiences, I have been committed to using data-driven analysis to inform policies that promote equity, inclusion, and poverty reduction.
